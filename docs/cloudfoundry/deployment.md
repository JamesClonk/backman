# Cloud Foundry deployments

Deploying backman onto Cloud Foundry is pretty straightforward.

All you need to do is edit the provided `manifest.yml` inside this repository and then push it.

---

## cf push

To deploy backman with a `manifest.yml`:

1. Clone this repository
2. Login to Cloud Foundry (`cf login ...`)
3. Create a new service instance of an S3-compatible object storage (`cf cs ...`) if not yet available
4. Modify the provided `manifest.yml`, specify the S3 service instance and any other of your service instance(s) accordingly
4. Configure backman through the environment variable `$BACKMAN_CONFIG` in your `manifest.yml`
5. Run `cf push -f manifest.yml`

Backman should now be up and running and you can visit the configured route from `manifest.yml` with your browser to have a look at the web UI. Any service bound to the app in Cloud Foundry will be automatically detected and should be visible on the web UI.
